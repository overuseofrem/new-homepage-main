# Attempt at a responsive homepage using CSS Grid (Frontend Mentor challenge)

this is a responsive homepage built using **HTML** and **CSS Grid** with a mobile-first approach.
this was a Frontend Mentor challenge i completed ~2 years ago. just now writing a README as I'm getting back into web dev.

## 📝 Solution Retrospective

> I found trying to make the page properly responsive really difficult although the end-product is OK.  
> I built it mobile-first and whenever I go from mobile to desktop, the navigation moves outside the page.  
> Haven't found a good way to deal with it yet and it's due to the buttons I used for the mobile navigation.  
> Also, the overlay that happens when the mobile navigation is on screen is weird, the rest of the background darkens but  
> images and buttons remain bright. I haven't figured out a way to fix it, it's the first time I've ever tried javascript.  
> If you have any advice of feedback, I'd be happy to hear them!

**Update:** I later learned the overlay issue was because I darkened the `background-color` instead of using an actual overlay element 😅
